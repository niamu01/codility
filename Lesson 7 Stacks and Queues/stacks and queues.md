- Here are described two structures used for storage of elements. 
- The structures will provide two operations: push (inserting the new element to the structure) and pop (removing some element from the structure).

### Stack
- the insertion of new elements takes place at the top and deletion of elements also takes place from the top.

### Queue
- new elements are inserted at the back but old elements are removed from the front.
